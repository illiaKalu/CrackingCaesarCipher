# CrackingCaesarCipher
Caesar cipher is a encryption techniques, that was created a wile ago by Julius Caesar. Decades after I will write a program that will crack it. Ofc there are a tons of implementations already (will not use any of them). 
To get more in: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher

go run should be a good command to execute a program.

For tests any online resource (e.g. https://planetcalc.ru/1434/ ) for generating caesarus cipher will be good.
Encrypted test paste into ROT1.txt
Result will be printed out in console.
